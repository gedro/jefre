Conceptually, it may be appropriate, therefore, to classify such jobs in the armed forces with similar civilian jobs.  This approach is adopted in several national occupation classifications.  Typically such classifications also identify a number of military-specific occupational groups.  In many countries, however, it is not possible to produce information about the nature of the work performed by members of the armed forces.  In adapting ISCO-08 for national purposes countries may wish, therefore, to consider what approach best suits their circumstances and user needs.  For purposes of international comparability, however, where data pertaining to members of the armed forces are reported and classified by occupation, they should be included, where possible, in ISCO-08 Major Group 0: Armed Forces Occupations.\n" }

In addition, managers usually have responsibility for and make decisions about: the overall strategic and operational direction of a business or organizational unit (for example about the kinds, quantity and quality of goods to be produced); budgets (how much money is to be spent and for what purposes); and the selection, appointment and dismissal of staff.  Supervisors may provide advice and assistance to managers on these matters, especially in relation to staff selection and dismissal, but do not have authority to make decisions.\nIt should be noted that it is not a necessary condition that managers have responsibility for all three of strategic and operational direction, budgets and staff selection and dismissal. The degree of autonomy they exercise may also vary. The critical difference is that supervisors are responsible only for the supervision of the activities of other workers, whereas managers have overall responsibility for the operations of an organizational unit.\n" }

In addition, managers usually have responsibility for and make decisions about: the overall strategic and operational direction of a business or organizational unit (for example about the kinds, quantity and quality of goods to be produced); budgets (how much money is to be spent and for what purposes); and the selection, appointment and dismissal of staff.  Supervisors may provide advice and assistance to managers on these matters, especially in relation to staff selection and dismissal, but do not have authority to make decisions.\nIt should be noted that it is not a necessary condition that managers have responsibility for all three of strategic and operational direction, budgets and staff selection and dismissal. The degree of autonomy they exercise may also vary. The critical difference is that supervisors are responsible only for the supervision of the activities of other workers, whereas managers have overall responsibility for the operations of an organizational unit.\n" }
